    <h2>1. Naruto Shippuden</h2>
    <p>
      The long-running Naruto series has been referred to as one of the “big three” anime because of its wild popularity around the world, and for good reason. It’s full of action-packed fight sequences, hilariously fun moments, and dramatic scenes that pull at your heartstrings. In Naruto Shippuden, the story takes a darker and more serious tone as the characters are now older and face even more daunting challenges from the shadows as well as themselves. The Naruto anime series is known for its memorable characters and relationships, and it continues to be one of the biggest shounen anime ever, even long after it has ended.

    <h2>2. One Piece</h2>
    <p>
      After almost 20 years, One Piece continues to entertain audiences worldwide with more than 1000 episodes. Going as long as the series has been with its pirate journey, it can be tough for any anime to keep up with fans both new and old. One Piece manages to do that with the amazing mind of Eiichiro Oda. The world building, the deep characters, the hilarious adventure, and the amazing adaptation that sometimes beats out the manga catapults this series to the top of shonen anime history. It’s through Oda’s vision that the series has had such a lasting impact on viewers throughout the years and it doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.

    <h2>3. Attack on Titan</h2>
    <p>
      On that day, humanity was reminded of the fear they held for the titans. Attack on Titan became an instant classic when it was first released in 2013. Following three friends, Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert, they fight alongside humanity's greatest soldiers against gargantuan Titans and the threats that lie beyond their city walls. What started as a typical shonen anime evolved into an amazing piece of art tackling themes of war, classism/racism, among other heavy topics. It’s hard to find anyone who has not felt the impact of this show, with director Alex Garland even calling out the series as a source of inspiration. A mixture of high-intensity action, slow character-driven scenes, and Game of Thrones-esque deaths that come out of nowhere culminate into one of the greatest anime to emerge from the modern age.

    <h2>5. My Hero Academia</h2>
    <p>
      Superhero stories are a dime a dozen, but My Hero Academia offers a unique twist on the familiar genre by focusing on Izuku Midoriya, a hero who was born without powers (but is determined to save people regardless) in a world full of folks with abilities. Even after he earns the "quirk" he's always dreamed of, MHA constantly finds ways to challenge Midoriya's traditional hero's journey by offering new twists on well-worn tropes, exploring what it means to be a hero with consistent humor and heart -- not to mention some spectacular action sequences. Between its stunning animation, loveable roster of well-developed supporting characters, and talent for coming up with some of the most ridiculous and unique superpowers ever committed to the screen, My Hero Academia is a breath of fresh air -- frequently silly, often sweet, and consistently surprising.

    <h2>6. Dragon Ball Z</h2>
    <p>
      Dragon Ball Z was a gateway drug for many a young anime fan, and for good reason. The series isn't particularly deep, as it basically revolves around superhuman martial artist Goku and his friends testing their mettle against an increasingly powerful and outlandish series of foes. But what the series lacks in terms of plot, it more than makes up for in humor, kooky characters and incredible action. How can you not have fun with a martial arts fantasy where most of the characters are strong enough to shatter planets with their bare hands?

    <h2>7. Haikyuu!!</h2>
    <p>
      There are not many sports anime that can knock it out of the park in almost every way but Haikyuu!! manages to do that. The series revolves around a fairly large ensemble consisting of a high school volleyball team. Even though that may seem like a hurdle, the character development is well balanced and you’ll find yourself rooting for each member whether their role is big or small. The animation from Production IG is top-notch as well, elevating the tension of each match and play to the point that you’ll be glued to the front of your screen all episode. Haikyuu!! succeeds in creating an amazing sports team formula that other similar series should strive for.

    <h2>8. Demon Slayer</h2>
    <p>
      The record-breaking Demon Slayer has blown up tremendously in the last few years and it’s not too surprising to those that have followed the series up until now. Every single episode of Demon Slayer is consistently impressive with smooth animation that never compromises its gorgeous art, incredible visual effects that bring the spectacular battles to life, and an amazing soundtrack that punctuates its many emotional high points. Not only that, Demon Slayer will make you laugh out loud thanks to the over-the-top absurdity of characters like Zentisu and Inosuke, and it’ll just as easily make you tear up with its heavy themes of loss and family.

    <h2>9. Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
    <p>
      Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses."

    <h2>10. Hunter x Hunter</h2>
    <p>
      Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) starts out with a familiar trope: A hero, in this case a young boy named Gon, leaves his small town for the first time on an adventure. He leaves the island on a quest to find his long-forgotten father who had left him behind. His only clue? He’s a world-famous licensed Hunter -- so Gon sets off to take the notoriously deadly exam and become a Hunter himself. It sounds mundane and almost cheery, but Hunter x Hunter is anything but. The emotional highs and lows and the arcs of both the protagonists and antagonists are some of the best. As with most shonen, the dramatic action is fantastic, too.
